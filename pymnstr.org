* Creating strings

Creating strings:
literal syntax
+, *, join,

beginswith()
endswith()

Structured output:
%, the interpolation operator
format
templates

json
xml

Breaking string apart:

indexing and slicing.
the split method.
partition

More advanced topics:

- raw strings
- unicode, Python 2 vs Python 3



clformat

string object methods, string module

Python strings are immutable, like tuples:

- Performance, objects can be reused
- Use as dictonary keys
- Safety, easier multi-treading
